Gene silencing is often considered the same as gene knockdown. When genes are silenced, their expression is reduced. In contrast, when genes are knocked out, they are completely erased from the organisms genome and, thus, have no expression. Gene silencing is considered a gene knockdown mechanism since the methods used to silence genes, such as RNAi, CRISPR, or siRNA, generally reduce the expression of a gene by at least 70% but do not eliminate it.','{\"pat_doc\": 520.0, \"pub_alt\": 591.0, \"pub_doc\": 3028.0, \"deals_num\": 0.0, \"grant_doc\": 207.0, \"clinic_alt\": 16.0, \"clinic_doc\": 11.0, \"grant_fund\": 74976900.0, \"pat_granted\": 176.0, \"companies_num\": 0.0, \"investors_num\": 0.0, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}','{\"pat_doc\": 13.2, \"pub_doc\": -3.1, \"clinic_doc\": 1.5, \"grant_fund\": -9870496.5, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}'),('2e2af2357ba3568e4606a936d6410a38','b1f6b055bf7f576af1fda25a04ce64a1','d6145a42d41428a7d112c8f6aaaadaa8','2023-09-08 00:54:04','2023-10-29 01:01:15','Life Science','Next Generation Biology','Cell Detection and Analysis','Digital Pathology',24,'Digital pathology is a sub-field of pathology that focuses on data management based on information generated from digitized specimen slides.

Creating AGI is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and of companies such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. The timeline for AGI development remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. Some argue that it may be possible in years or decades, others maintain it might take a century or longer, and a minority believe it may never be achieved. Additionally, there is debate regarding whether modern large language models, such as GPT-4, are an early yet incomplete form of AGI or if new approaches are required.','{\"pat_doc\": 10.0, \"pub_alt\": 5136.0, \"pub_doc\": 663.0, \"deals_num\": 0.0, \"grant_doc\": 22.0, \"clinic_alt\": 0.0, \"clinic_doc\": 0.0, \"grant_fund\": 8115196.0, \"pat_granted\": 0.0, \"companies_num\": 0.0, \"investors_num\": 0.0, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}','{\"pat_doc\": 0.8, \"pub_doc\": 35.5, \"clinic_doc\": 0.0, \"grant_fund\": -520216.8, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}'),('3883be0188eecee6c58ad83183e3fc4b','5790a7bed485dce7c0fd1fac61020f51','f1911fd26254d1cbfba1808fbf1f3025','2023-09-08 01:53:10','2023-10-28 23:46:12','Life Science','Lab & Future of the Factory','Automated Systems, Control, & Data','Organ-on chip',36,'An organ-on-a-chip is a multi-channel 3-D microfluidic cell culture, integrated circuit that simulates the activities, mechanics and physiological response of an entire organ or an organ system.

Gene silencing is often considered the same as gene knockdown. When genes are silenced, their expression is reduced. In contrast, when genes are knocked out, they are completely erased from the organisms genome and, thus, have no expression. Gene silencing is considered a gene knockdown mechanism since the methods used to silence genes, such as RNAi, CRISPR, or siRNA, generally reduce the expression of a gene by at least 70% but do not eliminate it.','{\"pat_doc\": 766.0, \"pub_alt\": 846.0, \"pub_doc\": 4642.0, \"deals_num\": 0.0, \"grant_doc\": 333.0, \"clinic_alt\": 16.0, \"clinic_doc\": 13.0, \"grant_fund\": 127228306.0, \"pat_granted\": 265.0, \"companies_num\": 0.0, \"investors_num\": 0.0, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}','{\"pat_doc\": 13.2, \"pub_doc\": -3.1, \"clinic_doc\": 1.5, \"grant_fund\": -9870496.5, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}'),('4efb17ed8a92abe3db1718612398ff4d','3c24254d6c0d4e4249ab4b441e17dc83','abbcb6a1638f63a5747e204b798f4ec2','2023-09-08 00:41:06','2023-10-29 01:11:11','Life Science','Next Generation Biology','Synthetic Biology','DNA Synthesis',24,'DNA synthesis is the natural or artificial creation of deoxyribonucleic acid molecules.

A source of monochromatic light, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared, or near ultraviolet range is used, although X-rays can also be used.

It is particularly useful in identifying unknown compounds, determining the composition of complex mixtures and characterizing the chemical structure of biomolecules such as peptides, proteins and nucleic acids. In HRMS, ions are first generated from a sample and then separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio using a mass spectrometer. The ions are then detected and their masses are measured using high resolution detectors. The high resolution of the technique enables the detection of very small mass differences, which can be used to differentiate between compounds with similar molecular weights. HRMS has revolutionized the field of analytical chemistry and has become an indispensable tool for many applications in areas such as pharmacology, environmental science, food analysis and forensics.','{\"pat_doc\": 45.0, \"pub_alt\": 1833.0, \"pub_doc\": 491.0, \"deals_num\": 0.0, \"grant_doc\": 22.0, \"clinic_alt\": 1.0, \"clinic_doc\": 5.0, \"grant_fund\": 7901978.0, \"pat_granted\": 16.0, \"companies_num\": 0.0, \"investors_num\": 0.0, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}','{\"pat_doc\": 3.4, \"pub_doc\": -17.7, \"clinic_doc\": 0.7, \"grant_fund\": -1744859.1, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}'),('944715bf55c1d759123edef85407a64a','f75d09446940f86ed08ebd34eebf7374','aa6c75c69a90f2c711a2a5e31bb1c990','2023-09-08 01:34:12','2023-10-29 00:06:22','Life Science','Novel Modalities','Cell Therapy','mRNA sequencing',12,'mRNA sequencing refers to the process of analyzing the transcriptome of an organism by sequencing the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that are expressed in a given sample. mRNA is synthesized from DNA and contains the information required to make proteins, which are the building blocks of the cell.

IHC takes its name from the roots \"immuno\", in reference to antibodies used in the procedure, and \"histo\", meaning tissue. Albert Coons conceptualized and first implemented the procedure in 1941. Visualising an antibody-antigen interaction can be accomplished in a number of ways, mainly either of the following: â€¢ Chromogenic immunohistochemistry, wherein an antibody is conjugated to an enzyme, such as peroxidase, that can catalyse a colour-producing reaction. â€¢ Immunofluorescence, where the antibody is tagged to a fluorophore, such as fluorescein or rhodamine. Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors.','{\"pat_doc\": 379.0, \"pub_alt\": 28733.0, \"pub_doc\": 30861.0, \"deals_num\": 0.0, \"grant_doc\": 650.0, \"clinic_alt\": 553.0, \"clinic_doc\": 653.0, \"grant_fund\": 173900871.0, \"pat_granted\": 127.0, \"companies_num\": 0.0, \"investors_num\": 0.0, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}','{\"pat_doc\": 17.1, \"pub_doc\": -408.2, \"clinic_doc\": 134.5, \"grant_fund\": -28858320.2, \"capital_raised\": 0.0}'),('f64c3bc57c81631e8a2237e949057d17','b44ddb1f06c55c8a655b7e35627c4216','eb670a907e9a4e83aa692353515a741c','2023-09-05 19:20:24','2023-10-29 05:06:13','Life Science','Sustainability/Core','Formulation','Emulsion',36,'An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible owing to liquid-liquid phase separation.
